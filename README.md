# 🎮 Game Glitch Investigator: The Impossible Guesser

## 🚨 The Situation

You asked an AI to build a simple "Number Guessing Game" using Streamlit.
It wrote the code, ran away, and now the game is unplayable. 

- You can't win.
- The hints lie to you.
- The secret number seems to have commitment issues.

## 🛠️ Setup

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the broken app: `python -m streamlit run app.py`

## 🕵️‍♂️ Your Mission

1. **Play the game.** Open the "Developer Debug Info" tab in the app to see the secret number. Try to win.
2. **Find the State Bug.** Why does the secret number change every time you click "Submit"? Ask ChatGPT: *"How do I keep a variable from resetting in Streamlit when I click a button?"*
3. **Fix the Logic.** The hints ("Higher/Lower") are wrong. Fix them.
4. **Refactor & Test.** - Move the logic into `logic_utils.py`.
   - Run `pytest` in your terminal.
   - Keep fixing until all tests pass!

## 📝 Document Your Experience

- The games purpose is that the user guesses a number and gives hints till they are able to guess correctly in the given bounds
- There contained some bugs such as incorrect hints given to user after guesses, wrong number bounds for levels of difficulties, inconsistently calculating the number of attempts left
- With the help of AI, I corrected these fixes by creating prompts that identified exactly where the issue was, asked AI to check if the logic I am using is correct as compared to the "incorrect" code and applied fixes as they seemed right.

## 📸 Demo Walkthrough

Describe your fixed game in numbered steps so a reader can follow along without watching a video:

1. User select a game diffculty level
2. User chooses level easy and enters a guess of 20
3. Game returns "Too High"
4. User enters a guess of 10 → "Too Low"
5. Score updates correctly after each guess
6. Game ends after the correct guess or if user is out of attempts
